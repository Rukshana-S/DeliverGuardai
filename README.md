# DeliverGuard AI – Micro Insurance for Gig Workers

DeliverGuard AI is a parametric micro-insurance platform designed for delivery partners of Zomato.  
It protects workers from income loss caused by external disruptions such as rain, traffic, extreme heat, and environmental conditions.

The system uses AI monitoring, OCR verification, and fraud detection to ensure fair and automated payouts.

---

## Problem Statement

Delivery workers depend on daily or weekly earnings, but external factors such as:

- Heavy rain
- Flood
- Traffic congestion  
- Extreme heat  
- Environmental disturbances  
- Curfew / strike  

can reduce or completely stop their ability to work.

Currently, there is no reliable system to compensate short-term income loss.

Users can spoof GPS using fake location apps, making it appear they are working when they are not.

**Solution:**  
Continuously validate location consistency instead of trusting a single GPS point.

**How it Works:**  
1. Collect GPS coordinates periodically (every few seconds)  
2. Store previous and current locations  
3. Calculate distance between points  
4. Detect abnormal jumps (e.g., 100 km in seconds)  
5. Flag inconsistent movement  

**Tech Stack:**  
- `navigator.geolocation`  
- Haversine formula  
 

---

###  2. IP Address Verification

## Insurance Plans

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/InsurancePlan.png" alt="Insurance Plan" width="700"/>
</p>

| Plan     | Premium | Hour Threshold | Max Weekly Payout |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Basic    | 5%     | 8 hrs         | ₹2000             |
| Standard | 8%     | 6 hrs         | ₹4000             |
| Premium  | 10%    | 4 hrs         | ₹8000             |

---

## Premium Calculation

Weekly Premium = Weekly Income × Plan %

Example (Weekly Income = ₹7000):

- Basic → ₹350  
- Standard → ₹560  
- Premium → ₹700  

---

## Payout Calculation

### Hourly Income
Weekly Income ÷ 42 (6 hours/day × 7 days)

### Claim Types
- Day Claim → 6 × Hourly Income  
- Hour Claim → Threshold × Hourly Income  

### Final Rule
Final Payout = min(calculated amount, plan limit)

---

## Disruption Detection

The system uses real-time APIs:

- Weather API → Rain / flood  
- AQI API → Pollution  
- Traffic API → Congestion  

Trigger conditions:

- Rainfall ≥ 50 mm/hr  
- AQI ≥ 300  
- Traffic ≥ defined threshold

##  OCR-Based Income Verification

To ensure accurate and automated income verification, DeliverGuard AI uses **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** powered by EasyOCR.


###  Why OCR is Used

- Eliminates manual verification of income proof  
- Automatically extracts data from transaction screenshots  
- Speeds up onboarding and claim validation  
- Reduces human errors and improves efficiency  


###  How It Works

1. The user uploads a screenshot of their transaction or earnings proof  
2. The system uses **EasyOCR** to extract text from the image  
3. Key details such as:
   - Platform name (e.g., Zomato, Swiggy)  
   - Transaction amount  
   - Date and time  
4. Extracted data is processed and structured in the system


<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/Ocr.jpeg" alt="Ocr" width="700"/>
</p>


Example:  
Input:<br>
INR 3139 credited via ZOMATO<br>
Output:<br>
Premium Rate : 8% (Standard Plan)<br>Insurance Premium : ₹251


###  Fraud Prevention Mechanism

OCR alone cannot verify whether an image is original or edited. Therefore, DeliverGuard AI combines OCR with multiple validation techniques:

- Identifies inconsistent formatting in manipulated screenshots  
- Flags duplicate or reused images  
- Uses metadata analysis as an additional validation layer  


###  Cross-Verification with Delivery Platforms

To enhance reliability, the system can cross-verify user income with Zomato delivery platforms:

- The extracted income data is compared with actual earnings records  
- Ensures that the submitted screenshot matches real transaction history  
- Prevents fraud caused by edited or AI-generated screenshots  
- Acts as a strong validation layer beyond OCR  

> Since OCR only reads visible text, cross-verification ensures authenticity by validating the data from trusted sources.

###   Workflow
